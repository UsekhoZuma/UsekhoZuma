** `Aspiring Digital Wizard (Software Development and Data Science)` **

I am a 1st year Computer Science AND Mathematics major at the UFS. I work towards building effective applications that are not only useful, but directly solve real world problems. I am an Aspiring BackEnd Dev who plans to use knowledge of Calculus, Probability and Data Analysis to build working applications from the ground up. From being an idea to being a fully working model, each application is built with enthusiasm and care.

  <summary> <h3>🖥️My Coding Journey</h3> </summary>
  <p>
I  first fell in love with the idea of studying Computer Science during my sophomore year of high school. Although I only started coding in my gap year after Matric, that’s when I picked up the basics of Python and discovered how much I enjoyed problem-solving through code.

In 2025, I began my Computer Science studies, where I expanded my skills into C#, HTML, and JavaScript. With every project and concept, my passion for coding grew stronger, and I started seeing how each language opens up new ways of building and creating.

My journey is still ongoing, with SQL being the next milestone as I continue exploring the world of software development and beyond.
