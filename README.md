# Usekho Zuma

** Aspiring Software Developer **

I am a 1st year Computer Science AND Mathematics major at the UFS. I work towards building effective applications that are not only useful, but directly solve real world problems. I am an Aspiring BackEnd Dev who plans to use knowledge of Calculus, Probability and Data Analysis to build working applications from the ground up. From being an idea to being a fully working model, each application is built with enthusiasm and care.
